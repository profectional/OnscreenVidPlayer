# Installation

This application requires Python and K-Lite Codec Pack to function properly. If you do not have these installed, you can easily set them up by following the steps below:

1. Run the `setup.bat` file. If a warning appears, click on "More options" and proceed with running it. When prompted in the terminal, type 'y' to install Python (type 'n' if you already have Python installed and just need K-Lite Codec). Alternatively, you can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/).

2. If you prefer to manually install the K-Lite Codec Pack, you can find the installer in the `TransparentVideoPlayer/module` directory. If you do not trust the provided installer, you can download it from the [official website](https://codecguide.com/download_kl.htm).

3. If you have chosen to manually install the prerequisites above, navigate to the `TransparentVideoPlayer/module` directory and run `module_setup.py`.

Please note that Linux and MacOS are not currently supported, but support for these platforms may be added in the future.

# Usage

To start the application, run `start.py` or open the terminal/command prompt, navigate to the application's directory, and type:

```bash
python start.py
